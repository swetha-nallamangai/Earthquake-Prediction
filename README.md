# Earthquake-Prediction
This project analyzes earthquake data using machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of future seismic events. It includes data preprocessing, feature importance analysis, and model evaluation.

# Data Preprocessing:
  Cleaning and handling missing data.
  Normalizing and transforming features for better model performance.
  
# Feature Importance Analysis:
  Identifying key features that influence earthquake predictions.
  Visualizing the relationship between input variables and outcomes.

# Model Training and Evaluation:
  Training models such as Random Forest, Decision Trees, or XGBoost.
  Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

# Prediction and Insights:
  Generating predictions on test data.
  Interpreting results to assess the reliability of the predictions.
